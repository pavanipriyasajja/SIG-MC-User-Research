# Multi-Cluster Kubernetes UX Research & Survey

## 📌 Purpose

This repository is dedicated to documenting our **user research and survey efforts** aimed at understanding the challenges and needs of engineers working with **multi-cluster Kubernetes environments**.

As organizations scale their cloud infrastructure, managing multiple Kubernetes clusters has become a common but complex practice. Through this research initiative, we aim to build more intuitive, effective, and centralized multi-cluster user experiences.

The Kubernetes Template Project is a template for starting new projects in the GitHub organizations owned by Kubernetes. All Kubernetes projects, at minimum, must have the following files:

- a `README.md` outlining the project goals, sponsoring sig, and community contact information
- an `OWNERS` with the project leads listed as approvers ([docs on `OWNERS` files][owners])
- a `CONTRIBUTING.md` outlining how to contribute to the project
- an unmodified copy of `code-of-conduct.md` from this repo, which outlines community behavior and the consequences of breaking the code
- a `LICENSE` which must be Apache 2.0 for code projects, or [Creative Commons 4.0] for documentation repositories, without any custom content
- a `SECURITY_CONTACTS` with the contact points for the Product Security Team 
  to reach out to for triaging and handling of incoming issues. They must agree to abide by the
  [Embargo Policy](https://git.k8s.io/security/private-distributors-list.md#embargo-policy)
  and will be removed and replaced if they violate that agreement.
