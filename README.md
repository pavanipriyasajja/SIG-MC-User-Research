# Multi-Cluster Kubernetes UX Research

## ðŸ“Œ Purpose

This repository is dedicated to documenting our **user research and survey efforts** aimed at understanding the challenges and needs of engineers working with **multi-cluster Kubernetes environments**.

As organizations scale their cloud infrastructure, managing multiple Kubernetes clusters has become a common but complex practice. Through this research initiative, we aim to build more intuitive, effective, and centralized multi-cluster user experiences. This research is not tied to a specific implementation or tool. Instead, it is focused on understanding the diverse realities of engineers, architects, and platform teams working across multi-cluster setups.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals & Objectives

  
- Understand the current practices of engineers managing multiple clusters.

- Identify pain points in monitoring, observability, and workload visibility.

- Gather input on expectations for centralized UIs and multi-cluster interfaces.

- Inform the design and development of improved fleet management and syncer tools.

- Explore user requirements around multi-cluster fleet management, including how clusters are registered, synchronized, and updated.

- Understand how users track and interact with the cluster inventory, including expectations for metadata, health status, and grouping.

- Identify challenges in cross-cluster scheduling and workload placement, especially around performance, policy, and affinity rules.

- Investigate real-world experiences with multi-cluster pod networking, including service discovery, DNS, and network policies.











The Kubernetes Template Project is a template for starting new projects in the GitHub organizations owned by Kubernetes. All Kubernetes projects, at minimum, must have the following files:

- a `README.md` outlining the project goals, sponsoring sig, and community contact information
- an `OWNERS` with the project leads listed as approvers ([docs on `OWNERS` files][owners])
- a `CONTRIBUTING.md` outlining how to contribute to the project
- an unmodified copy of `code-of-conduct.md` from this repo, which outlines community behavior and the consequences of breaking the code
- a `LICENSE` which must be Apache 2.0 for code projects, or [Creative Commons 4.0] for documentation repositories, without any custom content
- a `SECURITY_CONTACTS` with the contact points for the Product Security Team 
  to reach out to for triaging and handling of incoming issues. They must agree to abide by the
  [Embargo Policy](https://git.k8s.io/security/private-distributors-list.md#embargo-policy)
  and will be removed and replaced if they violate that agreement.
